  "syrox": "Syrox isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player do everything hax$ does, a little slower? Syrox puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and ligament damage again. Mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Hax$ breaks his hands. Syrox 3-0's S2J. You can keep your SoCal. I prefer Colorado."
